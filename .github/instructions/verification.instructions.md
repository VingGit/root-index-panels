# Verification contract

Select checks in proportion to the change, but do not treat a component snapshot or successful build
as proof of host composition, SPA/base-path routing, responsive behavior, or packaged consumption.

## Baseline and evidence

Before source edits, inspect scoped status/diffs, record plugin and parent Quartz revisions, run
`npm ci`, and capture relevant baseline checks. When host behavior matters, inspect current Quartz
docs/source/types and a clean rendered host before freezing the implementation decision.

After edits, record exact commands, results, revisions, pages, selectors, and pre-existing warnings.
Assertions must exercise intended and negative paths; absence of an observed failure is not proof.

## Focused data and option tests

Retain parameterized cards/list coverage for:

- listed-physical book eligibility, root-note exclusion, reserved/excluded namespaces, destination
  proof, metadata index selection, count rules, date sources/ranges, deterministic sorting,
  deduplication, and one-pass access;
- physical versus FolderPage, TagPage, Canvas, Bases, unlisted, duplicate, dotted, spaced, Unicode,
  malformed, leading/trailing/doubled/dot/backslash slug cases;
- exact runtime normalization for every option, shallow maps, own properties, accessors, inherited
  entries, revoked/throwing proxies, and soft failure;
- icon alias/built-in precedence, all accepted accent forms, invalid/injection forms, no raw values in
  hooks, no cross-book appearance leakage, and theme-neutral defaults;
- per-render `en-US`, `fi-FI`, and unsupported-locale fallback; and
- large synthetic input that detects repeated full scans without timing-sensitive benchmarks.

For sidebar inventory, parameterize input order and duplicates. Assert:

- root/book context selection and authored-root fallback;
- book index excluded from visible children but retained as the dedicated home destination;
- physical and generated nested folder-index destinations, titles, and hidden index notes;
- selected versus exact-current state, active ancestry, and cache isolation;
- distinct note/Canvas/Base leaves and collision/provenance rejection; and
- FolderPage absence with physical indexes versus folders that genuinely lack a destination.

## Server-rendered root component

Prove:

- `.rip-overview` is the first direct plugin-body child;
- the latest preview follows the overview and contains at most three books in deterministic newest
  order;
- authored HAST appears exactly once after the preview and before unique `#rip-books`;
- the localized Explore library action targets `#rip-books`, remains visibly highlighted at rest,
  and has hover/focus/reduced-motion/forced-color coverage;
- the latest section contains its heading without a redundant explanatory paragraph, and authored
  content has no trailing return action;
- the complete library contains every eligible book exactly once, independent of preview order;
- headings, links, callouts, tables, code, transclusion output, supported style/script nodes, and safe
  `cssclasses` survive public HAST conversion;
- an empty tree omits only the authored-content wrapper;
- `toc`, `readingTime`, `text`, `fileData`, and HAST inputs are not deleted or mutated;
- statistics, localized UTC dates, semantic `<time>`, no-date omission, empty state, and cards/list
  accessible names are exact; and
- every sort combination is deterministic, stable, and preserves all entries while leaving the
  latest preview untouched.

## Server-rendered sidebar component

Prove one labelled navigation region and:

- a compact root/book home anchor plus adjacent native book switcher;
- descriptive home accessible names/tooltips, localized badge, exact-current `aria-current`, and
  active/neutral transitions;
- exactly one selected switcher entry with localized hidden selected text;
- no visible book-index or nested-folder-index document entry;
- ordinary folder-row anchors targeting actual index routes;
- separate disclosure buttons with `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls`, no navigation, and no custom
  positive tab index;
- correct default open/closed states and nested active ancestry;
- current note preservation while an ancestor is collapsed;
- correct relative destinations under root, deep routes, and base-directory fixtures;
- safe decorative hooks, distinct note/Canvas/Base SVGs, Explorer opt-in emission, and valid
  zero/one/many/long-label states;
- scoped book accents on selected rows, exact-current home, and collapsed hidden active paths without
  cross-book leakage; and
- current backgrounds and rails stay inside the selected interactive row rather than applying to a
  containing folder or the full browser tree.

## CSS and inline scripts

Freeze the five permitted host-selector kinds and fail on additional host suppression:

1. exact default-frame/direct-plugin tablet/mobile grid containment;
2. exact direct-plugin mobile width/wrap containment and only its allowed properties;
3. exact default and Canvas direct Explorer sibling variants with true opt-in;
4. exact direct-plugin Canvas-frame border-box containment; and
5. exact default-frame book-scope breadcrumb rule hiding only the redundant non-only first element.

Host-shaped DOM/CSS checks must leave Search, PageTitle, toolbars, Graph, TOC, Backlinks, the right
slot, unrelated navigation, and custom frames untouched. Root breadcrumbs remain normal. Reject
JavaScript that queries or rewrites Explorer, Breadcrumbs, or right-side components.

Verify desktop/tablet/mobile display, native mobile close then wide resize, long labels, switcher
popup containment, per-entry accent isolation, print, forced colors, reduced motion, and coarse
pointers. The switcher menu must reset the selected book's inherited custom accent while preserving
book-specific overrides. Freeze the card radial
gradient, bottom hairline, 300ms opacity, focus parity, two-pixel lift, and absence of the superseded
accent-border/title hover.

Panel and sidebar scripts must cover initial load, repeated Quartz `nav`, cleanup, navigation away and
back, multiple/zero matching components, no duplicate listeners, and no empty cleanup registration.
Panel navigation covers modified-key rejection and Arrow/Home/End boundaries. Sorting covers invalid
values and all four modes. Sidebar covers one-open switcher behavior, selected-link close, outside
pointer, Escape focus restoration, folder disclosure, active-ancestor collapse without navigation,
and cleanup.

## Manifest, API, distribution, and package

Assert:

- `Object.keys(packageJson.quartz.components)` is exactly `["RootIndexSidebar"]`;
- sidebar metadata/version/default left position/priority and boolean `replaceExplorer` schema/default
  are aligned;
- no manifest entry registers `RootIndexPanels`, but built root, `./components`, and `./types` expose
  every documented runtime/type export;
- validators, declarations, source maps, side effects/resources, dependency graph, notices, CI,
  package allowlist, and committed `dist/` cover every changed output;
- every generated JavaScript entry has only intended externals, no accidentally bundled singleton,
  no unexpected bare runtime import, and no dependency source resolved from an ancestor; and
- `npm pack --dry-run` plus a temporary consumer import prove shipped resources and public types work
  without source files.

## Isolated Quartz integration

Use plugin-owned isolated runners or a temporary stock-shaped checkout. Do not rewrite the actual
parent's upstream files. Cover relevant combinations of:

- cards/list and `replaceExplorer` true/false;
- default and Canvas frames;
- SPA on/off;
- `en-US`, `fi-FI`, and unsupported locale;
- root, root note, book landing, ordinary/nested note, physical folder landing, FolderPage-generated
  landing, TagPage, Canvas, Bases, unlisted/encrypted control, and 404;
- FolderPage enabled and disabled, with physical-index controls; and
- root/deep routes below a base directory such as `/group/project/`.

Inspect generated HTML and resources, not only exit status. Require one sidebar and one root body,
overview/latest/authored-root/full-library order, exact scope/state/icons/links, retained root metadata,
existing destinations, base-path-safe resources, Graph in the default right slot, scoped Explorer
replacement, book-first/root-normal breadcrumbs, Canvas stage visibility, and no duplicate SPA
resources or browser errors.

For fresh CLI behavior, run stock local/packed add, inspect the one layout stanza and lock entry,
enable/build, assert one body/sidebar, remove cleanly, and after push repeat remote add/enable/build
against the exact commit. Never infer remote usability from a local cache overlay.

## Browser and accessibility review

For popup, card, breakpoint, folder disclosure, Canvas drawer, breadcrumb, or host-composition
changes, use a real browser at representative desktop (>1200px), tablet (800–1200px), and mobile
(<800px) widths. Require no plugin-induced horizontal overflow.

Verify:

- selector opening causes zero Explorer layout shift, stays within the viewport, disables covered
  underlay, and restores focus correctly;
- root → book → folder landing → nested note → collapse ancestor → other book → root preserves route,
  Back/Forward semantics, one component/listener set, and no console/network errors;
- keyboard, pointer, touch, no-JS, SPA, 200%/400% zoom, long labels, Unicode, light/dark, forced colors,
  reduced motion, and coarse pointers remain usable;
- selected home/neutral transitions and collapsed hidden active-path cues are visible without relying
  only on color;
- real Canvas/Base routes retain correct leaves and Canvas stage/controls at 1440, 801, 800, and
  mobile; and
- card computed styles match the decorative contract without replacing the focus cue.

## GitLab Pages and FolderPage diagnostic

When investigating non-root 404s:

1. inspect the deployed `public/` artifact for expected ordinary note `.html` files;
2. distinguish missing generated folder indexes from missing ordinary pages;
3. inspect `CNAME`, `data-basepath`, canonical URLs, asset paths, and the 404-page home link;
4. require the configured base path to match either custom-domain-root hosting or project-subpath
   hosting consistently; and
5. verify that disabling FolderPage removes only generated folder landing routes when physical
   indexes are absent.

A root-only Page Type cannot explain existing ordinary `.html` files becoming unreachable under an
inconsistent public base path.

## Durable fixture and watch diagnostics

When the change touches host integration or content semantics, audit the persistent three-book lab
against its reference. Expected counts come from a clean render and physical/listed model, not raw
file counts or optimistic Canvas/Bases assumptions.

Rerun the add/change/delete watch diagnostic. Record stale watch behavior honestly, then stop the
watcher and prove a clean/full build corrects root panels, latest dates, overview, and sidebar
inventory. The known watch limitation is pre-approved; full-build defects are not.

## Command gate

Use Prettier write mode only on changed files. Run the relevant subset while iterating, then the
complete gate for source, manifest, dependency, or distribution changes:

```bash
npm ci
npx prettier --write <changed-plugin-files>
npm run check
npm run build
npm run verify:dist
npm run verify:package
npm run test:integration
npm run test:watch-integration
npm pack --dry-run
git diff --check
```

`npm run format` checks formatting; it does not write fixes.
